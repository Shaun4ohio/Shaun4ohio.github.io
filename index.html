<p>Cutting right to the obvious question: Why would a 25 year old choose to run as a non-party candidate for an extremely powerful 
  federal office against an experienced, well-funded, incumbent? It sounds crazy, but there are three main problems that I feel need
  to be addressed ASAP in the United States Congress. Unfortunately, I have lost all faith that the candidates chosen by the 
  Democrat and Republican establishment will solve them. </p>

<p>I am not alone in this sentiment, of course, and that is my key to victory. It is true that I cannot win by converting party 
  loyalists alone. My campaign will go no where unless 10,000&#8217;s of people who normally sit out show up for me on election day. 
  The numbers are there; approximately half of the eligible voters in my district stayed home in 2018. If you are one, I have a 
  simple message- Your voice matters. Politics matters. The government&#8217;s power matters, and it is we the people that decide 
  how to wield it! </p>

<br>
<br>
<div class="weDecide"  >
  <b>
  <p>We decide if we want our government to pay for concentration camps on our southern border, 
    or if we pay for people who cannot afford to properly treat their illness. </p>

  <p>We decide if we want our tax money to fund forever wars and instruments of death,
     or if we want to fund serious efforts to curb pollution and climate change. </p>

  <p>We decide if we want a government that gives money to people who already have plenty, 
    or a government that spends money to defend due process for people who cannot afford it. </p>

  <p>We decide if we want a congress that speaks for a few special people, or a congress that speaks for EVERYONE! </p>

  <p class="quote"><q>I don’t care who does the voting, so long as I get to do the nominating.</q> <br> - Boss Tweed</p>
  <p><strong>Problem:</strong>&nbsp;The US government has never been about liberty and justice for all, but it can be.&nbsp;Our politics are increasingly controlled by rich people who donate to political parties. Our representatives do not&nbsp;represent&nbsp;the concerns of everyday people- especially poor people from the inner cities and rural America.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>Solution:&nbsp;</strong> I will fight for realistic policies that will have an immediate, positive, effect on regular people. We will have to fight the people who have a vested interest in the status quo.  </p>

  <p><strong>Proposals:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

  <ul><li><strong>Freedom Dividend:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Monthly, unconditional, cash payment for all citizens age 18 and older.&nbsp;To be funded by a 10% sequestration on all federal agencies’ budgets and from a carbon tax.&nbsp;<ul><li>Income security will help those who are displaced by the dynamic, global, and increasingly automated&nbsp;economy.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Giving labor more bargaining power will increase wages,&nbsp;expand the things that count as work,&nbsp;and help more people find work they&nbsp;actually like.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Redistribute&nbsp;wealth&nbsp;from rich to poor and from those who pollute more to those who pollute less.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Wealthy people contribute disproportionally to climate change and will be less effected in general. Poor people will suffer the most despite contributing less.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></ul></li></ul>

  <ul><li><strong>Complete Free Trade:</strong> 20% annual phase out on ALL import tariffs over 5-year period. Reduce&nbsp;or eliminate&nbsp;restrictions on imports on things like prescription drugs.&nbsp;<ul><li> The only people who benefit from consumers paying more for “made in America” are those who sell that&nbsp;product. Everyone else pays more and has less to spend on other things.&nbsp;EX: US Pharmaceutical Drug Makers.</li><li>American companies also pay tariffs and/or “made in America” premium, and they pass this cost on to the consumer.&nbsp;A few people benefit, most people lose.&nbsp;</li><li>Carbon tax will be assessed on fuel required to ship goods across oceans/borders. This will effectively be a flat tariff on all imports that will benefit local business when there is marginal comparative advantage.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></ul></li></ul>

  <ul><li><strong>Medicaid Opt-In:&nbsp;</strong>Provide a public option for health insurance to compete with private insurance. Those who do not currently qualify for Medicaid will pay additional taxes on excess income.&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>We already pay more for health insurance than every other advanced nation, to worse results.</li><li>Insurance middlemen play an important role in this expensive, convoluted system, but increasing the supply of medical services will also reduce costs.&nbsp;</li><li>Government must make it easier for new companies to compete in healthcare. Examples: legal protection for companies operating in “good-faith”, reform drug patent system, reform medical licensure, reduce restrictions on currently illegal/prescription-only drugs.&nbsp; </li></ul><ul><li>Again, a&nbsp;few wealthy people and established companies&nbsp;benefit from our healthcare system&nbsp;(Steve Chabot is one)&nbsp;while most other people lose.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></ul></li></ul>

  <ul><li><strong>Reclaim War Powers:</strong> The average citizen has a say in US military action via congress, but only of the elected members want to address executive military action.&nbsp;<ul><li> Pressure members of congress to vote on the authorization of ALL military force- even if it is inconvenient to them. The American people deserve to know who is keeping wars going and why.</li></ul></li></ul>

  <ul><li><strong>Reform Immigration Law:</strong> Allow for free migration of workers and their families, who will be eligible for Dividend after 5 years of paying income tax&nbsp;and will be eligible to vote (full citizenship) after 18 years of law-abiding residency.&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>Immigrants produce value,&nbsp;bring diverse knowledge and skills,&nbsp;create new businesses, and increase tax revenue.&nbsp;</li><li>People who come here seeking to improve their own lot will grow the pie for everyone and should be welcomed.&nbsp;</li><li>Laws should be applied to people equally regardless of their citizenship.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></ul></li></ul>

  <p class="quote"><q>We knew we could not make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities.</q> <br> - John Ehrlichman</p>

  <p><strong>Problem:&nbsp;</strong>Our laws are&nbsp;too often&nbsp;designed by powerful people to keep&nbsp;regular&nbsp;people under control. Those&nbsp;with money/influence can essentially do whatever they want.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>Solution:&nbsp;</strong>Repeal laws that cannot be equally enforced&nbsp;on&nbsp;everyone. Whenever the state must choose who is&nbsp;going&nbsp;to be held accountable, they inevitably choose they poorest, most vulnerable people. We must also&nbsp;redirect&nbsp;funding&nbsp;towards&nbsp;the pursuit of justice so that a defendant&#8217;s personal wealth does not have an impact on their&nbsp;criminal&nbsp;defense.&nbsp;</p>
    
  <p><strong>Proposals:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <ul><li><strong>End the War on Drugs.</strong>&nbsp;Decriminalize the possession of all recreational intoxicants.&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>Allowed licensed, non-profit, agencies to produce and sell addictive substances,&nbsp;undercutting&nbsp;street dealers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li> This will reduce money being spent in black markets, reduce deaths, reduce access for minors, and create an environment where addicts can seek help.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Selling drugs outside of this regulated framework will still be punished.&nbsp;&nbsp;  </li></ul></li><li><strong>Reform Bail System.</strong> My goal is that no one should sit in jail for more than 7 days without being convicted of a crime, or arraigned for a violent crime. This can be done by increasing federal funding  for public defenders, local courts, and other judicial institutions.   <ul><li> For most offenses, suspects can and should be released on their own reconnaissance to await trail. Cases for which this is not viable should be expedited. </li><li>While spending will increase in the short term, reducing incarcerated populations will decrease spending in the long run.</li><li>This is an investment in the justice for regular people.   </li></ul></li></ul>

<div id="Climate Change" class="tabcontent">

  <p class="quote"> <q> Humans everywhere share the same goals when the context is large enough. […] If we are to survive, our loyalties must be broadened further, to include the whole human community, the entire planet Earth.</q> <br> - Carl Sagan  </p> 

  <p><strong>Problem:</strong>&nbsp; Human activity is changing the climate in chaotic ways. Right now, we have carbon communism, where everyone is financially responsible for the cost of everyone else’s carbon emissions. As a result, individuals have little incentive to invest in the reduction their own carbon footprint. Companies have little incentive to reduce their footprint because it usually adds to the cost of their product and makes them less competitive.  </p>

  <p><strong>Solution</strong>:  We must find a realistic way to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible. We must do so in a way that helps the people who will suffer most both from the changing climate and from the increased costs of a carbon-free economy. Such a policy should incentivize individuals and companies alike to reduce their carbon footprint by providing a financial reward to do so. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Proposals:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <ul><li><strong>Carbon Tax</strong>:  Impose a tax on energy generation, fuels production, and other industrial processes so as to establish a price for greenhouse gas emissions. The cost should be based on an estimate of their contribution to the financial cost of climate change. <ul><li>Redistribute tax income with the Freedom Dividend so that the regressive, inflationary effects&nbsp;of such a consumption tax&nbsp;are&nbsp;offset.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Income being equal,&nbsp;people/companies who&nbsp;are above-average&nbsp;polluters&nbsp;will&nbsp;lose money, while those who&nbsp;are below average&nbsp;polluters&nbsp;will&nbsp;gain&nbsp;money.&nbsp;</li><li>Taxing carbon emissions will incentivize companies to invest in reducing their energy use and eventually transition to zero net carbon energy like nuclear, bio-gas, wind, and solar.&nbsp;</li><li> Create a market for carbon offset programs like sequestration, composting, and capture, etc. by allowing for negative emissions to be assessed a negative tax.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></ul></li></ul>

      <p>I was born in Cincinnati in 1994. Before I reached the 1st grade, my family moved to France for my Dad&#8217;s work and we 
        lived on the outskirts of Paris for my elementary school years. At the time, it was not possible for me to understand the value 
        that living in a different country provides. It showed me that, even though people everywhere are very similar, they see and 
        perceive the same events in different ways. It is critically important for anyone who seeking to represent the people 
        in this country to understand that. Far from being a homogeneous nation state, the United States is just what the name implies. 
        Long before most state lines were drawn, our nation was settled by many distinct groups of people who came from all over and 
        had little in common. There were some problems that they all shared however, so a government was formed to deal with them. 
        This struggle for a more perfect union, one that balances personal freedom, diverse people, and effective governance, 
        continues to this day. </p>



      <p>When my family moved back to Cincinnati I was in the 5th grade. I attended all of middle and high school at the Wyoming 
        Public School system, supposedly one of the best public schools in the country. The sheer amount of luck and privilege that 
        allowed me to have the experiences I did growing up was still not evident to me at the time. The path I was born onto of 
        course sent me to college next. I attended The Ohio State University on my parent&#8217;s dime, and got a degree in
        Engineering Physics with a concentration in Nuclear Engineering. I soon realized that I have no interest in using my 
        degree to work a regular engineering job in corporate America. Instead, I want to make good on the debt I owe to the tax 
        payers of Ohio, having attended a publicly funded university despite coming from a wealthy family. I knew from a young age
        that I wanted to use math and science to help people and solve problems. I could not have told you a few years ago that 
        doing so would involve me running for congress, but here we are. </p>



      <p>My education did provide me with valuable skills that I am confident would serve my constituents well in congress.
          I am able to effectively break down and digest complicated topics that I have never seen before. 
          My STEM coursework essentially thought me the best way for me to learn and teach myself. It is not likely that my book 
          knowledge of Quantum Mechanics will be useful when writing legislation, but the methods I used to acquire that knowledge 
          will be. That being said, I did acquire hard skills that will be useful in congress; never underestimate the power that
          a competency in mathematics provides, for example. I would not be able to program my own website without my eduction 
          either, or without some help from a good friend, which brings me to my next point. I also learned about good teamwork and 
          the benefits of diversity. I collaborated with many people who knew things that I did not, and could do things that I 
          could not. By working together towards a shared objective, we were able to accomplish more than any of us could have alone.
          This relates to diversity because the things we do and know are really just a sum of our past experiences. 
          People who come from different places, cultures, and environments do and know things that I do not. Being able to capitalize 
          on this diversity with effective teamwork is what makes America great, if you&#8217;re asking me. </p>

  </div>
  
  <div id="Strategy" class="tabcontent">
      <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'">X</span> 
      
      <h3 class="w3-center"> Election Math: </h3>

      <p>There are two important variables that will determine the success of my campaign: Non-Voter Turnout Rate (NVT), and Major Party Defection Rate (DR). The total estimated voting population in the district is 560,000, of which I consider 300,000 to be likely voters based on the previous two elections. This leaves 260,000 likely non-voters. The equations for my votes and the republican votes are as follows.</p>
      
      <p class="w3-center">My Votes = 300,000 ×&nbsp;DR + 260,000 ×&nbsp;NVT</p>    
      
      <p class="w3-center">R Votes = 0.55 ×&nbsp;300,000 ×&nbsp;(1 &#8211; DR)</p>
      
      <p>The assumptions behind these equations are that Republicans make up 55% of the likely voters (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Partisan_Voting_Index">R+5 District</a>), and that they are unlikely to gain a significant share of non-voters.  By plugging in values for the DR and NVT, I can figure out the magic numbers that will give me more votes than Steve Chabot. It turns out that if both are just 25% (0.25), I win the election by almost 20,000 votes. My strategy will be to convert 25% of party loyalists, and to turnout 25% of the non-voting population, and send my 25 year old ass to congress.</p>
      
      <p class="weDecide">We can do this! <br>We can win!</p>
      
      <h3 class="w3-center">Short Term Goals:</h3>

      <p>In the short term, my goal is to show that the two party duopoly is vulnerable to anyone serious about giving a voice to 
        the voiceless. There are many reasons why so many eligible voters choose to sit out of the political process. They may 
        have correctly deduced that they are one of the people that neither of their two choices care about. They may have 
        incorrectly surmised that their individual contribution won’t make a difference. Maybe they have taken a good look at the 
        ugly side of our public discourse and decided to just stay neutral. Whatever the case may be, my victory condition involves 
        drawing just 25% of the possible non-voters to polls on November, 3 2020.  If the people who normally can&#8217;t be 
        bothered to vote show up and rebuke the establishment  puppet-masters, politics as we know it in this country will never 
        be the same.</p>
        
      <p>As far as converting party loyalists, I simply hope to show them the two party system as I see it. I see both parties 
        are equally subservient to moneyed interests. I see it as problematic that the vast majority of both Democratic and 
        Republican lawmakers are themselves extremely wealthy, and take huge donations from Pharmaceutical drug makers, defense 
        contractors, and tech companies to name a few. By donating to the DNC and RNC directly, these wealthy donors can 
        essentially choose the party nominees before there is even an election, leaving the voters with two choices that both 
        truly represent big business. To be clear, I do believe that large companies deserve to have some voice in congress. 
        They provide valuable products and services that benefit us all to some extent. But I reject the notion that congress 
        invariably doing &#8220;what&#8217;s best for business&#8221; is always in the interest of the average citizen. A large 
        corporation and government inaction can trample human rights just as easily as any dictator. There needs to be balance. 
        There need to be members of congress who fight for the people&#8217;s interest.</p>   
      
      <h3 class="w3-center">Long Term Plan:</h3>
      
      <p>Long term, I hope to become part of a non-party caucus in congress. When this group is large enough to prevent either 
        democrats or republicans from forming a majority in the House, the two party reign is over. Right now, 
        in addition to being able to pass votes, the majority side gets to pick the Speaker of the House, an incredibly 
        powerful and underrated position. The speaker gets essentially full control over the legislative agenda and house committee 
        chairs/members. The speaker is chosen by a majority role call vote, which currently has only two warring factions. 
        If the non-party caucus has enough members to force the democrat and republican candidates for speaker to compromise 
        and form a coalition, there will be no more partisan stranglehold in the House. This process is similar to how other 
        countries choose their Prime Minister. </p>

      <h3 class="w3-center">Step One:</h3>

      <p>In order to get myself on the ballot as a non-party candidate in the November 3rd general election, I must acquire 
        signatures from registered voters in <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Ohio%27s_1st_Congressional_District">Ohio&#8217;s 1st 
        district</a>. The number of signatures needed is equal to 1% of the total number of votes casts in the previous election:
        about 3,000. Once this is done, the election will then be at least a three way completion among me, Steve Chabot, and the 
        democratic establishment&#8217;s choice from their primary election. In order for your signature to count, you must be 
        currently registered to vote in Ohio&#8217;s 1st District. Please check the interactive map below if you aren&#8217;t sure 
        what district you live in.</p>


      <p>There are two ways I plan to collect signatures. First, me and other volunteers will post up in public places: libraries, 
          parks, events downtown etc. We will try to get signatures from passers-by and encourage those who have already heard of us 
          and want to sign to find us. The specific places and dates will appear on Social Media as and when I schedule them. 
          The second way I plan to get signatures is through door to door canvasing. If you or someone you know wants to sign my 
          petition, or volunteer to help me get signatures, get in contact with me by email at shaun4ohio@gmail.com or connect with 
          me through my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Shaun4ohio">Facebook Page</a>. If you cannot make any of my planned events for whatever reason, we can come to you.</p>


       <p>If you are not yet registered, there are
         <a href="https://boe.hamilton-co.org/register-to-vote-and-update-registration/how-to-register.aspx"> many ways</a> to do so
         today. If the address you want to register at matches the address on your driver&#8217;s licence, you can 
         <a href="https://olvr.sos.state.oh.us/">register online</a>. You can also print out and mail in your registration form. 
         Many public venues like schools, libraries, and DMV&#8217;s provide registration forms and/or mail them in for you. 
         Register yourself and help a friend! It is a good idea to register ASAP so that I can file my signatures ASAP. 
         The sooner I get on the ballot, the better, and it may take longer to register the closer we get to deadline. 
         My goal is to have secured ballot access before November 3rd 2019, 1 year before election day. </p>
