<p>I know what you're thinking; Why would a 26 year old choose to run for a powerful federal office as a non-party candidate against an experienced and well-funded incumbent? 
  It sounds crazy, but believe me, you would not be reading this right now if I hadn't been able to honestly answer that question for myself. You would not be reading this
  right now if I didn't honestly believe we can win. I am running because our country has some major problems that need to be addressed ASAP in the United States Congress. 
  Unfortunately, I have lost all faith that Democrat and Republican politicians will solve these problems. 
</p>

<p>I am not alone in this sentiment, of course, and that is my key to victory. It is true that I cannot win by converting party loyalists alone. 
  My campaign will go nowhere unless 10,000's of people who normally sit out show up for me on election day. 
  The numbers are there; approximately half of the eligible voters in my district stayed home in 2018. If you were one of them, I have a 
  simple message- Your voice matters. Politics matter. The government's power matters, and it is we the people that decide how to wield it!
 </p>

<br>
<br>
<div class="weDecide"  >
  <b>
    <p>WE DECIDE if we want our government to pay for overcrowded prisons,
      <br> or a government that spends money to defend due process for people who cannot afford it.</p>

    <p>WE DECIDE if we want our tax money to fund forever wars and instruments of death, 
      <br> or if we want to fund serious efforts to curb pollution.</p>

    <p>WE DECIDE if we want a government that gives money and power to people who already have plenty,
      <br>  or if we provide affordable healthcare for people to properly treat their illnesses.</p>

    <p>WE DECIDE if we want a congress that speaks for a few special people,
      <br>  or a congress that speaks for EVERYONE! </p>

  <p class="quote"><q>I don’t care who does the voting, so long as I get to do the nominating.</q> <br> - Boss Tweed</p>
  <p class="quote"><q>We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, 
    which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.</q> <br> -Sun Tzu’s Art of War </p>
  <p><strong>Problem:&nbsp;</strong>The US government has never been about liberty and justice for all, but it can be. Our politics are increasingly controlled by rich people 
    who donate to political parties. Our representatives do not represent the concerns of everyday people- especially people from the inner cities and Rural 
    America.</p>

  <p><strong>Solution:&nbsp;</strong> I will fight for realistic policies that will have an immediate, positive, effect on regular people. We will have to fight the people who have 
    a vested interest in the status quo.  </p>
  <p><strong>Proposals:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Freedom Dividend: </strong>
      Monthly, unconditional, cash payment for all citizens age 18 and older. To be funded by a 10% sequestration on all federal agencies’ budgets and from a Greenhouse Gas Tax (GHGT).
      <ul>
      <li>Income security will help those who are displaced by the dynamic, global, and increasingly automated economy.</li>
      <li>Giving labor more bargaining power will increase wages, expand the things that count as work, and help more people find work they actually like.</li>
      <li>Redistribute wealth from rich to poor and from those who pollute more to those who pollute less. </li>
      <li>Wealthy people contribute disproportionately to climate change and will be less affected in general. Poor people will suffer the most despite contributing less.</li>
      </ul>          
    </li>

    <li><strong>Complete Free Trade: </strong>
      20% annual phase out on ALL import tariffs over 5-year period. Reduce or eliminate import restrictions on things like prescription drugs.
      <ul>
      <li>The only people who benefit from consumers paying more for “made in America” are those who sell that product. Everyone else pays more and has less to spend on other things. 
        Example: US Pharmaceutical Drug Makers.</li>
      <li>American companies also pay tariffs and/or “made in America” premium, and they pass this cost on to the consumer. A few people benefit, most people lose.</li>
      <li>Greenhouse Gas Tax will be assessed on foreign products and fuel required to ship goods across oceans/borders. 
        This will effectively be a flat tariff on all imports that will benefit local business when there is marginal comparative advantage.</li>
      </ul>          
    </li>

    <li><strong>Medicaid Opt-in & Healthcare Deregulation: </strong>
      Provide a public option for health insurance to undermine insurance companies. Deregulate medical care services to lower costs in the healthcare market.  
      <ul>
      <li>We already pay more for health insurance than every other advanced nation, to worse results.</li>
      <li>Health insurance companies as we know them today run a billion dollar racket and provide no tangible service. I welcome their demise, 
        but getting rid of them will not solve all our problems. Having the federal government do a complete takeover of insurance is also undesirable.</li>
      <li>Government must make it easier for new companies to provide healthcare. Examples: legal protection for companies operating in good-faith, reform drug patent system, 
        reform medical licensure, reduce restrictions on currently illegal/prescription-only drugs.</li>
      <li>Again, a few wealthy people and established companies benefit from our healthcare system (Steve Chabot is one) while the majority of people lose.</li>
      </ul>         
    </li>

    <li><strong>Reclaim War Powers:</strong> 
      The average citizen has a say in US military action via congress, but only of the elected members want to address executive military action.
        <ul>
        <li>Pressure members of congress to vote on the authorization of ALL military force; even after the fact and even if it is inconvenient to them.</li>
        <li>Repeal 9/11 AUMF for the war on terror and make congress vote every 90 days to keep troops in a forgeign country or not. The American people deserve to know 
          who is keeping wars going and why.</li>
        </ul>          
    </li>

    <li><strong>Reform Immigration Law: </strong> 
      Allow for free migration of workers and their families, who will be eligible for Dividend after 5 years of paying income 
      tax and will be eligible to vote (full citizenship) after 18 years of law-abiding residency.   
      <ul>
        <li>No matter their birthplace, people are people and we need to treat them like people.</li>
        <li>Immigrants produce value, bring diverse knowledge and skills, create new businesses, and increase tax revenue.</li>
        <li>People who come here seeking to improve their own lot will grow the pie for everyone and should be welcomed.</li>
        <li>Laws should be applied to people equally regardless of their citizenship.</li>
      </ul>          
    </li>

  <p class="quote"><q>We knew we could not make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with 
    heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities.</q> <br> - John Ehrlichman 1971(?)</p>
  <p class="quote"><q>I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the moderate. 
    I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, 
    but the moderate, who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; [...] who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom.
    </q> <br> -MLK’s Letter from Birmingham Jail, 1963  </p>

  <p><strong>Problem: </strong>Our laws are too often designed by powerful people to keep everyone else under control. Those with money and influence can essentially do whatever 
    they want. They can easily pay the flat fines assessed for petty infractions. They can afford the best lawyers and privacy when they actually do something horrible. </p>

  <p><strong>Solution: </strong>Repeal laws that cannot be equally enforced on everyone. Whenever the state must choose who is going to be held accountable, 
    they inevitably choose the poorest, most vulnerable people. We must also redirect funding towards the pursuit of justice so that a defendant’s personal wealth 
    does not have an impact on their criminal defense. </p>
    
  <p><strong>Proposals:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>End the War on Drugs: </strong>
    Decriminalize the possession of all recreational intoxicants.
      <ul>
      <li>Allowed licensed, non-profit, agencies to produce and sell addictive substances, undercutting street dealers.</li>
      <li>This will reduce money being spent in black markets, reduce deaths, reduce access for minors, and create an environment where addicts can seek help.</li>
      <li>Selling drugs outside of this regulated framework will still be prohibited.</li> 
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Reform Bail System: </strong> 
    In America no one should sit in jail for more than 24 hours without being convicted of a crime, or arraigned for a violent crime.
      <ul>
      <li>The first step in this process is to stop arresting people for victimless and petty crimes.</li>
      <li> For most offenses, suspects can and should be released on their own reconnaissance to await trial. Cases for which this is not viable should be expedited. </li>
      <li>While spending will increase in the short term, reducing incarcerated populations will decrease spending in the long run; 
        this is an investment in justice for regular people.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Demilitarize and Rebrand the Police: </strong> 
    Police in this country are out of control. They are not judges or juries; they are certainly not executioners. Many of them have no business being public servants. 
    They are enforcers of an idiotic criminal “justice” system that must be uprooted. I question the motives of an individual who would want to enforce our laws as they stand today.
      <ul>
      <li>Police serve the wealthy, influential, and powerful people- protecting them from everyone else. They do not protect or serve the poor because our laws do not 
          serve the poor. We need to clean up our laws that allow broken window policing, and then clean house at most PDs.</li>
      <li>Violence begets violence. It is time for local, state, and federal governments to stop paying people to escalate violence. Any officer who escalates a situation 
          is unfit to serve and must be blacklisted.</li>
      <li>Most of the money spent on policing would be better spent on the front end to attack the causes of lawless behavior. </li>
      </ul>          
    </li>

    <li><strong>Abolish the Department of Homeland Security: </strong> 
    DHS has outlived its usefulness, if it ever had any. It should come as no surprise that the agency created to protect us at any cost would end up violating our right to privacy
    turning its guns on citizens protesting an unjust system. 
      <ul>
      <li>The concentration camps of non-citizens for the “crime” of being in America is abhorrent and must end. We should not want a government capable of rounding people up into camps. </li>
      <li>You don’t have to look very far into the past to see American citizens have their right to freedom stripped away in a racist and counterproductive manner. </li>
      <li>Using DHS budget money to create a strong financial safety net for people will have a better effect on public safety than anything the DHS does. </li>
      </ul>          
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="quote"> <q> Humans everywhere share the same goals when the context is large enough. […] If we are to survive, our loyalties must be broadened further, to include 
  the whole human community, the entire planet Earth.</q><br>- Carl Sagan</p> 
  <p class="quote"> <q> If you want to make small changes, change the way you do things. If you want to make major changes, change the way you see things </q><br> -Don Campbell</p>

  <p><strong>Problem: </strong>Human activity is changing the climate in chaotic ways. Right now we have carbon communism, where everyone is financially responsible 
  for the cost of everyone else’s carbon emissions. As a result, individuals have little incentive to invest in the reduction of their own carbon footprint. 
  Companies have little incentive to reduce their footprint because it usually adds to the cost of their product and makes them less competitive.  </p>

  <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We must find a realistic way to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible. We must do so in a way that helps the people who 
  will suffer most both from the changing climate and from the increased costs of a carbon-free economy. Such a policy should incentivize individuals and companies alike 
  to reduce their carbon footprint by providing a financial reward to do so.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Proposals:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Greenhouse Gas Tax (GHGT): </strong> 
    Impose a tax on energy generation, fuels production, and other industrial processes to establish a price for greenhouse gas emissions. 
    The cost should be based on an estimate of their contribution to the financial cost of climate change. 
      <ul>
      <li>Redistribute tax income with the Freedom Dividend so that the regressive, inflationary effects of such a consumption tax are offset.</li>
      <li>Income being equal, people/companies who are above-average polluters will lose money, while those who are below average polluter swill gain money </li>
      <li>Taxing carbon emissions will incentivize companies to invest in reducing their energy use and eventually transition to zero net carbon energy like nuclear, 
      bio-gas, wind, and solar.</li>
      <li> Create a market for carbon offset programs like sequestration, composting, and capture, etc. by allowing for negative emissions to be assessed a negative tax. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>National Lab Expansion: </strong> 
      We currently have 17 national labs funded by the Department of Energy; I am calling for at least one national lab in every state. 
      <ul>
      <li>These labs should have corporate sponsors collaborate on shared problems. Example: Boeing & GE sponsoring green jet fuel research.</li>
      <li>These labs would have development programs for those seeking to enter skilled, non-STEM trades, as well as entry level STEM jobs for HS grads. </li>
      <li>Discoveries, reports, and patents produced by these labs must be made free and accessible to everyone in the world, forever.</li>
      </ul>          
    </li>

    <li><strong>National Rapid Transit System: </strong> 
      Domestic airline flights and personal vehicle commutes are a massive and unnecessary source of greenhouse gas pollution that need to be reduced as much as possible. 
      <ul>
      <li>We need an investment in green infrastructure the likes of which we have not seen since the Highways Act. </li>
      <li>This new project should try to undo the racist legacy of our existing car-centered infrastructure.</li>
      <li>Department of Defense money should be redirected towards our infrastructure instead of building new warships, warplanes, missiles etc.</li>
      </ul>          
    </li> 
    
    <li><strong>Licensure Support & Reform: </strong> 
      Money should not be an obstacle for those seeking professional licensure; especially if they already have student debt.
      <ul>
      <li>If a license is required by the state to perform a job, that state must provide materials and tests to all qualified applicants free of charge. </li>
      <li>There must be transparency in the licensure process. State boards should not be limiting the supply of professionals to ensure higher wages 
        for those already with a professional license. </li>
      <li>Generally, we must make education, licensure, and knowledge cheaper and more accessible to everyone. It is time to stop letting companies profit off 
        information that should be provided as a public good. </li>
      </ul>          
    </li>
  
    <li><strong>New Nuclear in Ohio: </strong> 
      Ohio is an excellent state to build nuclear reactors; lots of space and low probability of natural disasters. We need to build some in order to be 100% carbon free 
      and help stabilize the electric grid. 
      <ul>
      <li>Climate refugees are likely going to flock to states like Ohio as sea levels rise and hurricanes continue to obliterate communities; 
        We need to prepare for increased residential and industrial electricity users. </li>
      <li>I would like to see Ohio build at least one AP1000 and 10 Nucsale SMRs. </li>
      <li>The funding should come from a consortium of public bonds, corporate investment, and power plant shares for individuals. </li>
      </ul>

      <p>I was born near Cincinnati in 1994 and my family would soon move to France for my Dad’s work. We lived on the outskirts of Paris for my elementary school years. 
        I didn’t really understand at the time the value that living in a different country provides. Even though people everywhere are very similar, 
        they see and perceive the same events in different ways. Anyone seeking to represent the people in this country must understand that. 
        Far from being a homogeneous nation state, the United States is just what the name implies. Long before most state lines were drawn, 
        our nation was settled by many distinct groups of people who came from all over and had little in common. There were some problems that they all shared however, 
        so a government was formed to deal with them. This struggle for a more perfect union, one that balances personal freedom, diverse people, and effective governance, 
        continues to this day. </p>



      <p>When my family moved back to Cincinnati I was in the 5th grade. I attended all of middle and high school at the Wyoming Public School system, 
        supposedly one of the best public schools in the country which of course sent me to college next. I attended Ohio State and got a degree in Engineering Physics 
        with a concentration in Nuclear Engineering. I want to make good on the debt I owe to the taxpayers of Ohio, having attended a publicly funded university despite 
        coming from a wealthy family. I knew from a young age that I wanted to use math and science to help people and solve problems. 
        I could not have told you a few years ago that doing so would involve me running for congress, but here we are.
      </p>



      <p>My education provided me with valuable skills that I am confident would serve my constituents well in congress. I am able to effectively break down and 
        digest complicated topics that I have never seen before. My STEM coursework essentially taught me the best way for me to learn and teach myself. 
        It is not likely that my book knowledge of Quantum Mechanics will be useful when writing legislation, but the methods I used to acquire that knowledge will be. 
        That being said, never underestimate the power that a competency in mathematics provides. I would not be able to program my own website without my education either, 
        or without some help from a good friend, which brings me to my next point. I also learned about good teamwork and the benefits of diversity. 
        I collaborated with many people who knew things that I did not, and could do things that I could not. By working together towards a shared objective, 
        we were able to accomplish more than any of us could have alone. This relates to diversity because the things we do and know are really 
        just a sum of our past experiences. People who come from different places, cultures, and environments do and know things that I do not. 
        Being able to capitalize on this diversity with effective teamwork is what makes America great, if you’re asking me. </p>

  <div id="Strategy" class="tabcontent">
      <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'">X</span> 
      
      <h3 class="w3-center"> Election Math: </h3>

      <p>There are two important variables that will determine the success of my campaign: Non-Voter Turnout Rate (NVT), and Major Party Defection Rate (DR).
         The total estimated voting population in the district is 560,000, of which I consider 300,000 to be likely voters based on the previous two elections. 
         This leaves 260,000 likely non-voters. The equations for my votes and the republican votes are as follows.</p>
      
      <p class="w3-center">My Votes = 300,000 ×&nbsp;DR + 260,000 ×&nbsp;NVT</p>    
      
      <p class="w3-center">R Votes = 0.55 ×&nbsp;300,000 ×&nbsp;(1 &#8211; DR)</p>
      
      <p>The assumptions behind these equations are that Republicans make up 55% of the likely voters 
        (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Partisan_Voting_Index" target="_blank">R+5 District</a>), 
        and that they are unlikely to gain a significant share of non-voters.  By plugging in values for the DR and NVT, 
        I can figure out the magic numbers that will give me more votes than Steve Chabot. It turns out that if both are 
        just 25% (0.25), I win the election by almost 20,000 votes. <strong>My strategy will be to convert 25% of Democrat voters, 25% of Republican voters, 
          and to turnout 25% of the non-voting population</strong>.</p>
      
      <p class="weDecide">We can do this! <br>We can win!</p>
     
      <p>In order to get 140,000 votes, my goal will be to reach 400,000 people. This seems daunting, especially because I don't plan on raising even $400,000 dollars,
        but it can work if we manage to maintain exponential growth until november. By using an exponential function to model the number of people who have heard of the campaign
        I can calculate the growth rate we will need per day.  will live or die based on how excited people who hear my message are, and how many of 
        their friends they tell.</p>
      
      <h3 class="w3-center">Long Term Plan:</h3>
      
      <p>Long term, I hope to become part of a non-party caucus in congress. When this group is large enough to prevent either 
        democrats or republicans from forming a majority in the House, the two party reign is over. Right now, 
        in addition to being able to pass votes, the majority side gets to pick the Speaker of the House, an incredibly 
        powerful and underrated position. The speaker gets essentially full control over the legislative agenda and house committee 
        chairs/members. The speaker is chosen by a majority role call vote, which currently has only two warring factions. 
        If the non-party caucus has enough members to force the democrat and republican candidates for speaker to compromise 
        and form a coalition, there will be no more partisan stranglehold in the House. This process is similar to how other 
        countries choose their Prime Minister. </p>

      <h3 class="w3-center">Phase I: 3500 Signatures and Social Media Buildup</h3>

      <p class="w3-center">In order to get on the ballot as a non-party candidate in the November election, I must acquire 
        signatures from registered voters in <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Ohio%27s_1st_Congressional_District" target="_blank">Ohio's 1st 
        District</a>. The number of signatures needed is equal to 1% of the votes cast in the previous election for Governor:
        about 3,500. Once this is done, the election will most likely be a three way completion among me, Steve Chabot, and the 
        democratic establishment's choice from their primary election. In order for your signature to count, you must be 
        currently registered to vote in Ohio's 1st District. Please check the interactive map below if you aren't sure 
        what district you live in.</p>

      <p class="w3-center">While collecting signatures, I will also be building up the campaign’s social media presence. For practical and rhetorical reasons, 
        <strong>I will not be raising a dime of funds until I have secured a spot on the ballot</strong>. In the meantime, I will be focusing on free ways to 
        get the word out and grow a base of support that will eventually serve as our voting and donation base. Because our limiting factor 
        will be how many people hear about us, I consider a Like, Share, or Tweet a contribution with monetary value. The more people that 
        are exposed to the campaign, inside and outside of the district, the better off we will be on election day. I need everyone’s help 
        to achieve this. This may be the only advantage we have over Steve Chabot, who can do little to increase his name recognition at 
        this point. His voting base is established and vulnerable to poaching. Ours must grow exponentially starting as soon as possible.</p>

      <p class="weDecide">I consider a Like, Share, or Tweet a contribution with monetary value, <br>I need everyone’s help to get the word out!<p>

       <p class="w3-center">If you are not yet registered to vote, don't wait! Do it today. If the address you want to register at matches the address on your 
         driver's licence, you can <a href="https://olvr.ohiosos.gov/" target="_blank">register online</a>. You can also print out and mail in your registration form. 
         Many public venues like schools, libraries, and DMV's provide registration forms and/or mail them in for you.</p>
